# WebDevProject

The assignment was to choose between an online store or a blogging website.
I know how everybody always chooses the online store for a project so I chose differently 
and ended up being the only one who did this. 

The rules:
1. No frameworks were allowed
2. No CSS/HTML templates were allowed
3. The Project was to be done by no more than 1 student entirely from scratch
4. Bootstrap was allowed but only its .CSS files

NOTE:

This was my first PHP web project.
The website has no registration page, nor does it have a password recovery feature.
The project was simply intended for us prove we had mastered raw PHP to a certain degree.
I worked on this project for about 40-60 hours, counting the hours I spent understanding 
the meaning of PHP errors and learning how to debug PHP as fast as I can today.
I applied the MVC and Singleton design patterns as much as I could throughout the project.

Credits:

This project's code was written by me, Adolphe Munyankumburwa, in April 2018 
as instructed by the Erasmus University College (Brussels).
All code was written by me according to what I had learned by then.
The code that I've written during this project was mostly of my own doing.
Wherever code for external sources was used, I provided a comment with a reference to the source.

Other external sources are mentioned in the BRONNEN.txt file.

I am not the owner of any images I have used during this project.
All images came straight from Google Images.
