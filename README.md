# WebDevProject


This project's code was written by me, Adolphe Munyankumburwa, in April 2018 
as instructed by the Erasmus University College (Brussels).
All code was written by me according to what I had learned by then.
The code that I've written during this project was mostly of my own doing.
Wherever code for external sources was used, I provided a comment with a reference to the source.

Other external sources are mentioned in the BRONNEN.rtf file.

I am not the owner of any images I have used during this project.
All images came straight from Google Images.
